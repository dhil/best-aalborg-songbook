\beginsong{We are the Champions}[by={Queen}]\beginverseI've paid my duesTime after timeI've done my sentenceBut committed no crimeAnd bad mistakesI've made a fewI've had my share of sandKicked in my faceBut I've come throughAnd we mean to go on and on and on and on\endverse\beginchorusWe are the champions -- my friendsAnd we'll keep on fightingTill the endWe are the championsWe are the championsNo time for losers'Cause we are the champions of the World\endchorus \beginverseI've taken my bowsAnd my curtain callsYou brought me fame and fortuneAnd everything that goes with itI thank you allBut it's been no bed of rosesNo pleasure cruiseI consider it a challenge beforeThe whole human raceAnd I ain't gonna loseAnd we mean to go on and on and on and on\endverse\beginchorus\textit{(Chorus $2\times$)}\endchorus \endsong
