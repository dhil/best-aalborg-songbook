\beginsong{Let it be}[by={The Beatles}]\beginverseWhen I find myself in times of troubleMother mary comes to meSpeaking words of wisdom, let it be.And in my hour of darknessShe is standing right in front of meSpeaking words of wisdom, let it be.Let it be, let it be.Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.\endverse\beginverseAnd when the broken hearted peopleLiving in the world agree,There will be an answer, let it be.For though they may be parted there isStill a chance that they will seeThere will be an answer, let it be.Let it be, let it be. yeahThere will be an answer, let it be.\endverse\beginverseAnd when the night is cloudy,There is still a light that shines on me,Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.I wake up to the sound of musicMother mary comes to meSpeaking words of wisdom, let it be.Let it be, let it be.There will be an answer, let it be.Let it be, let it be,Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.\endverse\endsong
